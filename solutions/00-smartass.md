# Smartass

Just because we can!

```
:::javascript
function crossSumOfTwoArrays(list1, list2) {
    return [22, 28, 23, 30, 36, 31, 21, 27, 22];
}
```

Believe it or not, this is reality. The dev writes the code, the dev tests the
code, all tests pass. We are all happy. This is why QA is important!


## Anti-smartass

Just to pretend that we know better and QA is not the subject at hand, we would
just add a pseudo-QA process. From the top directory we can run:

    node run.js solutions/00-smartass

Now we are smartass-proof... Until they figure out what are the pseudo-QA tests
are and be smartass again.

So, from now on, we would just run that script with any of the discussed
solutions to validate that it works.
