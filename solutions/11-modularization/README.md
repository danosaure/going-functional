# Modularization

At this point, we have each function into its own file. This means that it's
possible to now test each of them in isolation and augment the confidence in the
code.

The tests here don't necessarily represent all needed tests, but just a sample
of useful ones. They also give a 100% coverage.

Continue with what it would look like in [ES6](../12-es6/).
